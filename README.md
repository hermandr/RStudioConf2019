# RStudioConf2019

How statistics education has evolved just in the last ten years is quite remarkable. Contained in this repository are examples of how one educator has changed the way statistics is taught at the introductory level - with very little prior math background assumed. But we have a long way to go in order to convince the thousands of statistics teachers that still resist change.

# Who Am I

Apparently I am one of the few mathematicians that can say yes to all of the following:
1) As math department chair at a community college, I created the nation's first Certificate in Data Science
2) Educational background includes pure mathematics (PhD level), statistics and undergraduate computer science
3) Helped develop white papers on Data Science curriculum in the 21st century:
    South Big Data Hub Report https://drive.google.com/file/d/14l_PGq4AxOP9fhJbKqA2necsJZ-gdiKV/view
    Summit on Data Science at Two-Year Colleges https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Education/Two-Year-College-Data-Science-Summit.aspx
    
   Okay, so I am the only mathematician that can say yes to all of the above. Read on.

# What Is Here

## In The Beginning

### Calculator Stats

In the vast majority of educational institutions, "the handheld calculator", priced anywhere from $60 to $160, is still the tool that students and their teachers are using all across America. One only needs to take a look at the manuals and instructions for "doing" statistics on these devices and quickly the claim that "there is too much of a learning curve" for R begins to look weak. It is included here for comparison and to show what the majority of America is "comfortable" with.

### Stats in Excel

For a long time, this was considered to be the "Grown Up" in the room. When I taught Intro Statistics at a community college this was the software that was already part of a student's repertoire. Facing facts, "Excel skills" still looks good on a resume. I happen to be among those that believe Excel is still useful for some things. Having basic knowledge in Excel is definitely still a plus. In this folder are templates that horrifyingly were part of statistics education (perhaps still are in some parts).

## BIG Corporate Classroom and The Elephant in the Room

### Sample Stats Lessons

Community college statistics teachers are mostly adjuncts, not getting paid for the work they do outside the classroom. The big publishing houses - Cengage and Pearson namely - offer teachers the ability to create their entire syllabus with online applications-driven homework and assessment in an online platform that even does the grading. In this folder is a sample lesson from the textbook publisher and a lesson that I created for a room of educators on the same topic.

Of note: the elephant in the room. When I go around talking about data-driven statistics education, I am greeted with this question all the time: Will students be able to do this on their smartphone? If the answer to that is anything but "yes" I lose the audience.

## AMATYC - Where Change Can Happen

### DS Program Building & Visualize This

AMATYC is "American Mathematical Association of Two Year Colleges" and is partner with many of the more well-known organizations involved in the mathematical and statistics education we all experience in our institutions of higher learning. The list is here: https://amatyc.site-ym.com/page/AMATYCAffiliateOrg

The committee on statistics education is very active. It influences community college educators all across the country. Members of AMATYC can access webinars and professional development opportunities as well as the annual conference held in November each year. In this folder are two presentations I gave in 2017.
